6 Steps to Solve Any Problem
  REACTO Approach
  - Don't start writing as soon as you see the problem!
  - Your brain will start committing itself to the wrong path!
  - This method (or any method really) will give you more time to THINK about the problem
    - Give your brain some time to think
  - Want to start a conversation with the interviewer

  ADDITIONAL ADVICE
  - stay calm -> These questions are meant to take time to work through
  - they know you're not a CPSC genius who can figure out everything in the time given LOL
  - it's more so to see if you've been *exposed to certain information/theory*
  - make it a conversation (TEAMWORK! Ask questions if you get stuck)
  - make interviewer comfortable
  - DONT START WRITING IMMEDIATELY !!!! (it's a reflex you need to get over)
  
1. Repeat
2. Examples
3. Approach
4. Code
5. Test
6. Optimization


Repeat
- make sure to understand the question (repeat it to yourself)
- make sure you don't immediately start down the wrong path!
- can try to understand (with interviewer) about things you don't understand

Examples
- simple examples to further help understading the problem
- parameter-output samples (can organize in a table)
- think of the problem as a "black-box" (and think about what outputs to expect, for some inputs)


Approach
- describe ALL approaches you CAN take (recursive, iterative, brute-force, heuristic)
- give insight into your logic/though process

Code
- now write your code
- "breadth-first coding" -> decompose your work/thinking/idea into high-level functions first
  - essentially, break down the problem into smaller steps
  - b/c it's easy to get too caught up in something that is trivial in nature...BUT: becomes very complex in the minutae details (ex: regex)]
- leave room between each line (if writing on a whiteboard)
- star things you're not sure about ("Im pretty sure about this...but will need more time to check it")
  - you will look more confident if you write such a phrase (tells interviewer you see potential improvements?)
- it's okay to use pseudo-code (THEY WANT TO SEE HOW YOU THINK!!!!)

Test
- important to show your due-diligence!!
- use another color marker to parse your code
- run the examples from the "Examples" step above


Optimization (will really differentiate you from the rest of the candidates)
- how will this perform?
- can talk about time/space complexity
- "Here's that I'm thining about optimization...."
- shows your maturity -> if this goes into production, what will happen?

Tip #4: Say "Can I think for a second?"
- silence is awkward
- therefore, clarify when you're thikning

Tip #3: Think out loud
- keep interviewer informed about where you are in your though process
- interviewer may even tell you if you're doing in the right direction
- **Think of the interview as a collaborative situation**

Tip #2: Use examples
- think of more examples to understand the problem
- will help you think in a more concrete way

Tip #1: Just ask them "Does this seem like a good strategy?"
- will make sure you are not going down the wrong path!
